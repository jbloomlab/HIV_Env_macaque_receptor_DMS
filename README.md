# Deep mutational scanning of HIV Env for entry using macaque CD4 / CCR5

This repository contains the computational analyses of Jeremy Roop's deep mutational scanning of HIV Env BF520 libraries in cells with macaque CD4 and CCR5.
It was copied by Jesse Bloom from Jeremy's computational notebooks, and made into a standalone repository.

The analysis and results are shown in the Jupyter notebook [analysis_notebook.ipynb](analysis_notebook.ipynb).
